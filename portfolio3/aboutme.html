            i’ve been chasing the best version of myself —<br>
            and for a while, i thought i saw it.<br>
            i started skating, fell more than i rolled,<br>
            but i loved the sound of the board hitting the ground.<br>
            i learned the drums, the electric guitar —<br>
            borrowed, not mine,<br>
            but the noise felt like progress.<br>
            maybe i was growing. maybe i was just pretending.<br>
            <br>
            i kept saying i was fine,<br>
            and most people believed it.<br>
            only two saw through the cracks.<br>
            they made me wonder —<br>
            can i really change?<br>
            can i rebuild what’s broken inside me?<br>
            or am i just repainting the same old walls?<br>
            <br>
            i talk more now,<br>
            smile more too,<br>
            but sometimes it feels rehearsed.<br>
            my confidence went up,<br>
            but my heart stayed quiet.<br>
            i tell myself i don’t care how i look —<br>
            but then again,<br>
            who even cares if i change?<br>
            who cares if i fail?<br>
            <br>
            i wanted to feel alive,<br>
            but somewhere in trying to heal,<br>
            i forgot how to *feel* at all.<br>
            i wanted to grow —<br>
            but maybe growth isn’t always healing.<br>
            maybe it’s just the pain evolving with me.<br>
